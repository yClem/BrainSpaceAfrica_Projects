			      <p class="container" id="subheading">THE BIBLE TEACHING</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">
			      	We believe that the entire Scripture, both Old and New Testament are written by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit – II Tim. 3:16-17. All the Christian teachings and the Christian attitude of the Children of God are such as are established in the Holy Bible – II Tim. 3:10-15; II Peter 1:21; John 17:17; Ps. 119:105.

					We believe that the Bible is the written and revealed Will of God. Man’s position to God, the way to obtain salvation, woe and destruction awaiting sinners that refuse to repent and everlasting joy that is kept for the born again souls. All the Bible teachings are holy, what the Bible reveals as the will of God are such that we should accept, and whatever God writes in the Bible and His Law are to remain unchangeable; for the Heavens and Earth may pass away but the Word of God stands forever. Deut. 4:22; Rev. 22:18, 19; Matt. 24:34-38.
			      </p>

			      <br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">ABOUT GOD: Ps. 33:6-9</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">
			      	As revealed unto us by the Bible, we believe that there is only one God, Who is the Creator of both visible and invisible creatures -Gen. 1:1; Ps. 86:9-10; Is. 43:10-11; John 1:1-3. Only God will be in existence forever. Ez. 3:14; in God every creature receives life -John 5:26.
			      </p>

			      <br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">ABOUT JESUS CHRIST</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">
			      	We believe that He is the Son of God; Who took away our sins, and the Savior of the world. We also believe that Jesus is God and was born by Mary the Virgin. He is God revealed in the flesh. Through Him all things were created. John 1:1-14; John 14:9; Matt. 1:18-25, Is 9:6; Is 53:5-6. We believe in His death on the Cross, and resurrection, by which He brought redemption – Is. 53:4-10; I Pet. 2:24; John 10:11; Gal. 3:13, Matt. 20:28; I Cor. 15:3; Rom. 4:25; II Cor. 5:14; Heb 2:9; Heb 9:26.

			      <br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">ABOUT THE HOLY SPIRIT</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">
			      	The Holy Spirit is the third Person in the TRINITY. He has the same power, the same glory with God the Father and God the Son – John 14:16-17; John 15:26; Matt. 3:16; Acts 13:24. He is one with Father and the Son who is to be worshiped and served. Three Persons that become one are the source of blessings to all the living creatures in Heaven and on earth – Matt. 28:19; II Cor. 13:14; I John 1:5-7. The Holy Spirit has a great work to perform. He Teaches, He Speaks to men, and bears witness in us – Acts 16:6-7; He performs the work of regeneration for man- John 3:5-6; He also performs the work of Sanctification in the born again souls until they are fully sanctified – John 16:8; Eph 1:17-19; II Thess. 2:13; I Cor. 6:11. This same Holy Spirit endows believers with gifts they can use – I Cor 12:7; He empowers one in the Lord. Acts 1:8.

			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">
			      The egg is comprised of three parts: The yellow yolk, the whitish part, and the shell. Despite these three (3) substances, the egg is not three but one. Likewise, we believe that God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost are one God, but made of three persons – hence they are ONE IN TRINITY – Gen. 1:16-29; Matt. 3:16-17; Matt. 18:19.
			    </p>


			    <br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">ABOUT THE DEVIL</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">
					We believe that there is a devil, who seeks the down fall of every man. He brought sickness, sin and death into the world. Gen. 3:1-16. He seeks the destruction of those who exercise their faith in the Lord Jesus. Matt. 4:1-11; James 4:7; I Peter 5:8. The devil has several unclean spirits over whom he governs – Matt. 12:24. A time would soon come when he shall be thrown into the pit and chained for one thousand years- Rev. 20:7-9. After this, he will be put into the lake of fire where he will remain suffering together with his followers for ever and ever. Rev. 20:10
				  </p>
				  

				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">ABOUT MAN</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">  	
					Things He created. Gen. 1:26. God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul – Gen 2:7. Therefore man is of three parts, namely body, soul and spirit. Man is God’s ambassador on earth to take control over all other creatures on His behalf on earth. Gen. 1:26-28. God allows man to take part in His work and thereby reveal His love for mankind more than any other creatures – Gen. 2:15. This also shows how God elevates man more than the other creatures upon the earth.
				  </p>


				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">REPENTANCE UNTO GOD</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">  
					Repentance is the sorrow of a godly man for his sins with decision to abstain from them – Acts 3:19; 20:21; II Cor. 7:10; Mark 1:15; Is. 55:7; II Chron. 7:14; Ezek. 18:21.
  				  </p>


  				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">JUSTIFICATION OR NEW BIRTH</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">   
					This is God’s grace whereby we are cleansed from our sins by which we are able to stand before God as though we have never sinned. Acts 13:39; Rom. 3:25-26; Rom 5:1; I Cor. 6:11; Gal. 3:24; John 1:12-13; 3:3; II Cor. 5:9; Titus 3:5; I Peter 1:23; Acts 10:43; John 3:3,5.
				  </p>
				  

				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">SANTIFICATION(HOLINESS)</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">     	
					Sanctification is another grace of God by which our souls are progressively and completely cleansed. This is the second accomplishment of the grace which through our faith in the Blood of Jesus Christ is wrought after we have been justified and free from our sins or regenerated – John 17:15-17; I Thess. 4:3; Heb. 2:11; 12:14; 13:12; I John 1:7; Luke 1:74, 75; II Cor. 7:1; I Peter 1:16; Eph. 5:25-27; I Thess. 5:23-24; II Thess. 2:13.

				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">WATER BAPTISM</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">   
					A. The Kinds of Baptism

					We believe in baptism by the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost – Matt. 28:19. The teaching is revealed in the New Testament and all Christians must obey this rule of the Lord – Acts 2:24; Acts 16:15; Acts 18:8; Acts 19:4-5. Every saved soul automatically qualifies for Water Baptism – Acts 8:29-39; 16:18-23.

 					Baptism by Trinity

					We believe that all members of this Church should receive immersion Water Baptism, in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, as believers who would not add to, or take out of the Word of God. Matt. 28:19. C. The Reason for Water Baptism Water Baptism stands for a sign and an example of two things.

					1. It is an outward sign, an example of a true repentance of a sinner from his or her sins. Acts 2:38; Acts 22:6

					2. Anybody who is baptized is joined with Christ in His death, burial and resurrection – Rom. 6:1 – 23; Col. 2:113. Therefore anybody baptized is dead to the world and the evils thereof – Gal. 6:14.
				  </p>
				  

				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">    	
					All born-again souls should ask for the Holy Spirit from above, as the Apostles were ordered to wait in Jerusalem until they were filled from above. It is the promise of the Father. It is God’s gift which He gives to those who obey Him – Luke 24:49; John 4:14-26; Acts 1:4-5; Acts 5:32; Acts 8:14-17. It is God’s promise unto those who are far and all whom the Lord shall call – Acts 2:38-39. Any Christian who receives the baptism of the Holy Spirit must speak in tongues – Acts 2:4; Acts 10:34-36; Acts 19:2-6.
				  </p>
				  

				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">ABOUT PRAYER</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">  	
					A Christian without condemnation of heart has a right to thank God and be in adoration and in prayer unto the Lord always – Zek. 12:10. His soul thirsts for God – Ps. 42:2. The Holy Spirit helps his infirmities in prayer – Rom. 8:26. We must pray only by the Name of JESUS – John 16:23; ; I Tim. 2:25. Without faith our prayer shall be powerless before God – James 1:6-8; Heb. 11:6. Those who are unable to pray annoy God – Is. 42:22; Is. 64:6-7. Much trouble and danger are encountered in the absence of prayer – Zeph 1:4; Dan 9:13-14; Hosea 8:13-14. We are commanded to pray and not to faint and to pray without ceasing – Col. 4:2; I Thess. 5:17; I Cor. 7:5; Luke 18:1. The Apostles put prayer first in their life and they spent much time in prayer – Acts 6:4; Rom. 6:4; Rom 1:9; Col. 1:9. It is God’s plan and order that we should pray to receive all the goods He has promised in His treasure for us – James 4:2; Dan. 9:3; Matt. 7:7-11; Matt. 9:24-29; Luke 11:13.
				  </p>


				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">ABOUT RESTITUTION</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">   
					Restitution is a sign of true repentance. This is payment for what is damaged – Ez.. 22:3. Whatever cannot give us a clear conscience before man and God should be restituted without delay – Lev. 6:1-7; Luke 19:8; Prov. 28:13; Acts 24:16.

					Healing without medicine is Biblical – Matt. 4:23; Ps. 103:3; Sickness is caused because of the fall of man. The force behind this is Satan – Job 2:1-9; Luke 13:15; Acts 10:3
				  </p>
				  

				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">DIVINE HEALING(WITHOUT MEDICINE)</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">	
					Healing without medicine is Biblical – Matt. 4:23; Ps. 103:3; Sickness is caused because of the fall of man. The force behind this is Satan – Job 2:1-9; Luke 13:15; Acts 10:3. But JESUS came to destroy the works of the devil – I John 3:8. Christ purchased our soul from the curse of sin. He bore our infirmities and carried our sorrow – Matt. 8:15-17. By His stripes we are healed. Is 53:4-5; Gal. 3:13; I Peter 2:24. Healing without medicine is of the Gospel – Matt. 9:35; Mark 6:10-18. We read that the twelve Apostles and the seventy disciples combined healing with their Ministry of the Gospel – Luke 9:1-2; Luke 10:1-9. The Lord commanded us to go into the world, just to teach the nations alone, but that we should also heal the sick – Matt. 28:19-20; Mark 10:1, Mark 16:15-18.

					We could obtain our healing in these four ways: 1. By individual prayer – John 14:13-14 2. By two people (or a group of people) who have agreed to pray by faith – Matt. 18:19-20. 3. By the laying of hands on the head – Mark 16:18; Acts 9:18; Acts 28:8. 4. By the Ministry of the Elders, anointing the sick with prayer of faith – James 5:14-15 Special Notice – Before we can work by healing without medicine, we would have sanctified our life to the doing of the Law – Rom. 6:13, 19; Rom. 12:1; Matt. 16:24; II Cor. 8:5, 15. Many miracles were performed by the Apostles – Acts 9:33-42; Acts 19:11-12; Acts 28:8-9.
				  </p>


				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">PROPHECY IN THE CHURCH</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">  
					The Bible teaches us to abstain from all appearance of evil – I Thess. 5:22. “But follow after righteousness, faith, love, purging ourselves from unclean things so that we may be vessels unto honor, sanctified, and prepared unto every good work” – II Tim. 2:21-22. Therefore we must not see our Church members in dancing halls, or cinema halls, reveling, for such things are works of the flesh. All people doing such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God – Gal 5:19-21; I Peter 4:3-4; Prov 31:4-5; Rev. 1:5-6; Gen 19:30-38.

					Swearing and Cursing Forbidden All Christians should not swear or curse or blaspheme for we were not taught of Jesus in such a way. “Bless, and curse not” Rom. 12:14. Swear not at all, neither by Heaven, nor by the earth or any other swearing. But let your yes by yes, and No be No so that you do not run into condemnation – Matt. 5:34; James 5:12.
                  </p>


                <br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">DUE REVERENCE TO PARENTS AND AUTHORITIES</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">  
					All Christians are to obey the law of the country, obey the government and authority. They should honor their parents and elders. I Peter 2:13-14; Rom 13:1-5; Eph. 6:1-3.
				  </p>


				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">REBELLION AGAINST CHURCH AUTHORITY FORBIDDEN</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">  
                 	Rebellion against Church Ministers is against the Will of God. Those who rebelled against Moses did not escape unpunished – Num 12:1-10; Num. 16:1-4,32. The Bible teaches that we should obey our Spiritual leaders and submit to them – Heb 13:17; Joshua 1:16-18.
                  </p>

                <br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">DEBTS FORBIDDEN</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">  
					Any member of this Church must not willfully enter into any debt which he finds difficult to repay for the Bible teaches us “owe no man anything, but to love one another” – Rom. 13:7-8. About Debt: 1. Monetary Debt 2. Debt of promise or Vow – Ps. 105:8 3. Debt of time – Eccl. 3:1-8 4. Debt of not preaching the Gospel – I Cor. 16-17
                 </p>


                <br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">OUR GARMENT</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText"> 
					We believe that any born again soul is a child of God and is clothed with white garment which is the Righteousness of Christ. It is received freely, a gift unto them that lead a victorious life – Rev. 19:7-8. Furthermore, we are advised to put on charity, which is the bond perfectness – Col. 3:13-14. It is not our policy to have special robes. We believe that all members must be moderate in adornment. “Not with braided hair, or gold or pears, or costly array, but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price” I Tim. 2:8-9; I Peter 3:1-6; Gen. 35:1-4; Ex. 32:1-8.
				 </p>


				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">LAYING OF HANDS AND ANOINTING THE SICK</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">
					We believe in the laying on of hands and anointing the sick on the head in the Name of the Lord and that prayer of faith shall save the person – James 5:14-16; Mark 16:17-18. But we do not use any other methods which are not according to Bible teaching such as sanctification of water for the sick to drink, or to perform special washing for the sick in the flowing river, the use of robe or garment, or to carry a small stick in the form of a cross ones person or the use of candles and such things. They are not Biblical. The order of our Lord is that we should heal the sick free of charge – Matt 10:8. We do not receive money or charge money before we offer prayer for anybody. All those using the above materials for healing shall perish with them – Mark 16:18; James 5:14; Matt 10:7-8; Mark 6:13.

					Swearing and Cursing Forbidden All Christians should not swear or curse or blaspheme for we were not taught of Jesus in such a way. “Bless, and curse not” Rom. 12:14. Swear not at all, neither by Heaven, nor by the earth or any other swearing. But let your yes by yes, and No be No so that you do not run into condemnation – Matt. 5:34; James 5:12.
				 </p>


				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">HOLY MATRIMONY</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText"> 
 					Marriage is honorable in all – Heb. 13:4. Therefore all members who wish to marry could do so in the church. They are not to follow the worldly patter with drumming and dancing, drunkenness or wear clothes that:30-31; I John 2:15-17; Rom. 12:2.
				  </p>


				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">PROPHECY IN THE CHURCH</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">
					We believe in all the prophecies in the Bible; likewise we believe that we can be given the gift of prophecy by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit – I Cor. 14:29. Despise not prophesying – I Thess. 5:20. But any prophecy that is against the Bible is rejected.
                  </p>


                <br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">CHURCH DISCIPLINE</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">  
					Above all, whatever is not Bible teaching should be ignored entirely by all members. If there be found any member disobeying these teachings he may be disciplined privately, but if any backslider would not admit discipline and restitute his way, he may be disciplined openly as it is written in Matt. 18:15-18, So that truth might be established by the witness of two or three according to the Word of God. Rebuke them that sinned before all that others also may fear – I Tim. 5:20; I Cor. 5:1-13; II Cor. 2:6-11; Heb. 12:5-12.

			      <p class="container" id="subheading">ONE HUSBAND, ONE WIFE, CORRECT DIVORCE AND RE-MARRIAGE</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">  	
					The Word of God teaches us that monogamy has been the order since the beginning of the Law of Christ. Divorce is permissible only when a life partner has committed adultery. Even then, neither of the two should be married to a new partner while both are yet alive – Matt. 5:31-32, 19:9; Mark 10:11-12; Luke 16:18; Rom. 7:2-3; Mal. 2:13-16; Gen. 2:18: Matt. 19:4-6.

				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">HOLY COMMUNION OR THE LORD’S SUPPER</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">  
					It is instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ shortly before His death. He commanded all Christians to gather together regularly to share the bread and wine till He comes back again – Luke 22:17-20; Matt. 26:26-29; Mark 14:22-25; I Cor. 10:18, 21; Acts 2:42; 20:7; I Cor. 11:23-30.
				 </p>


				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">THE CHURCH OF GOD</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText"> 
					The born-again souls are called the Church of God – Eph. 1:22; Col. 1:1-18; Eph 3:10; 5:24-29. The assembly of the believers, the sanctified souls in Christ Jesus, Those who we call the Holy people of God – I Cor. 1:2; Acts 14:23; Phil. 4:15; Acts 13:28. Therefore all that God has called to gather together in a place and fed with the Word of God – Acts 2:41-47; They accept Christ as the head of the Church. They gather from time to time to worship God in truth and Spirit to share the bread and eat. Their major assignment is to spread the Gospel of Christ to all Nations – Matt. 28:19.
                 </p>


                <br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">THE DEDICATION OR SEPARATION</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText"> 
					Dedication is very important for the children of God for the Lord is Holy – John 17:19; I Peter 1:15-16. If we want god to be our Father, we must separate and dedicate ourselves unto God – II Cor. 6:17-18. God called us unto Holiness – I Thess. 4:7; Rom. 12:1-2.
				  </p>


				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">THE DEDICATED CHRISTIAN</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">				  
					The dedicated Christian would avoid foolish talking or jesting, Eph. 5:4. He or she would not wear clothing of the opposite sex, Deut. 22:5. Marriage would be esteemed honorable in all respects in the life of the dedicated Christian, and he or she would be a hearer as well as a doer of the Word of God at all times.
     			  </p>


     			<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">THE DEAD IN CHRIST</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">  
					We believe that a brother who sleeps in the Lord is with Christ already – Phil. 1:21-23; I Cor. 5:1-9. Paul said that it is better to come out of this flesh and be with the Lord forever in our Heavenly home. Further still he emphasizes that ” But I would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as there which have no hope” I Thess. 4:13-18. Therefore all members should separate themselves form the things of this world in worshiping the dead by which we become idolaters – Deut 14:1.
				 </p>


				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">RESURRECTION</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText"> 
					We experience daily the resurrection of the Spirit, all the born-again souls who are passed from death to life – Eph. 6:14; Rom 6:11; John 5:20. As this body is dissolved, immediately we are entering into our Heavenly Home or house not made with hands eternal in the Heavens – I Cor. 5:1-8 There is resurrection of the Body. Jesus taught us plainly that the buried body will be raised up from the tomb at the last day Job 5:28-29. Paul also explained this to us – Acts 24:15; I Cor. 15:22, 42-44; Phil. 3:21; Dan. 12:2. Only Holy people will be at the resurrection those who belong to Jesus when He appears; but the sinners shall resurrect in hell, a place where people whose names are not found in the Lamb’s Book – Rev. 20:4-5; John 5:28-29; Rev. 20:12-15.
				  </p>


				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">  
					The Second coming of Jesus Christ will be in physical form and will be visible to all in like manner as He was seen ascending up to heavens – Acts 1:9-11; John 14:3. His return will be in two stages: A. Christ’s return in the sky – The Saints or Bride of Christ will be raptured to meet Christ in the sky – I Thess. 4:15-17; I Cor. 15:51-52; Matt. 24:40-44; Matt 25:10 B. His return to the earth – He will return to the earth to judge the sinners and the ungodly – Rev. 19:19-21; II Thess. 1:7-10; Jude 1:14-15; Zech. 14:3-4.
				  </p>


				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">THE TRIBULATION PERIOD</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">  
					The time between His coming to receive the brides or saints into heaven and His coming to administer judgments will be the time of Tribulation – Matt 24:21; 22:29; Rev. 9; Rev. 16; Is. 26:20-21; Mark 13:19; Jer. 30:7; Daniel 12:1; Malachi 4:1.
				  </p>


				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">THE MILLENNIAL REIGN (CHRIST 1,000 YEARS’ REIGN)</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">  
					After Christ appears upon earth, He would set up His Kingdom with the Holy people for one thousand years – Rev. 20:1-6; Rev. 2:26-27. This one thousand years will be entirely different from any kingdom ever set on earth. The Kingdom is peace all over – Is 65:18-20. There will be no death – Is. 65:18-20. There will be no poverty – Mich. 4:4; Is. 65:21-23; Christ is the ONLY KING in the Kingdom – Dan. 2:44-45; Dan. 7:13,14,22,27.
				  </p>


				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">SATAN IN PRISON</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">   
					At this time – millennium, Satan will be chained – Rev. 20:2-3, and it will be the time of peace and blessing to mankind also – Is. 11:6-9; 65:25; Hosea 2:18; Zech 14:9-20; Is 2:2-4.
				  </p>


				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">THE COMING JUDGEMENTS</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">  
					We believe that there will be three special judgements. i) The Judgement of the Believers: This would start immediately believers are caught up in the sky, they shall stand before Christ. After this judgment they will descend down with Christ upon the earth – II Cor. 5:10; I Cor. 3:3; 11-15; James 1:12; Rom 2:16. ii) The Judgement of the Nation: This will be the time when Jesus appears upon earth between the millennial reign and final judgement. Acts 17:31; Joel 3:2; Ez. 14:15; Jud. 1:14-15; II Thess 1:7-10; Rom 2:16; Rev. 1:7; Mal. 16:21. iii) The Judgement of the Unbelievers: or the White Throne Judgement : This will happen after Christ’s one thousand years reign at the White Throne. – Rev. 20:11-15; II Peter 3:7; Dan. 12:2.
				  </p>


				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">NEW HEAVEN AND NEW EARTH</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">  
					The Word of God teaches us that after judgement, this wicked world will be removed. God will create a new Heaven and a new earth in which HOLINESS will exist – Matt. 24:35; II Peter 3:12-13; Rev. 21:1-3; Is. 65:17:; 66:22
				  </p>


				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">ETERNAL LIFE AND ETERNAL PUNISHMENT</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">  
					The Bible teaches us that there is eternal punishment as well as eternal life – Matt. 25:46. The wicked people will be sent to a fiery hell made of sulphur, to be tormented both day and night. The punishment will continue forever and ever – Rev. 14:10-11; Luke. 16:24; Mark 9:43-44.
				  </p>


				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">DEDICATION OF CHILDREN</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">  
					We believe that after a child is born on the 8th day, the parent should bring himher unto the House of the Lord for dedication unto the Lord – 1 Sam. 1:22; Luke. 22:22-24; Matt. 19:13-15.
				  </p>


				<br>
			      <p class="container" id="subheading">THE LORD’S DAY</p>
			      <p class="container" id="HopeText">   
					We believe that the first day of the week called Sunday is a special day which the believers should separate as the Lord’s day during which time are to gather to worship – Acts 20:7; 1Cor. 16:2; Rev. 1:10. The Lord resurrected on the first day of the week – Mark 16:9; Ezek. 31:12-14.
